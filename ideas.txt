I’m not an expert but here is what I do:

Before a game, go through every unit in my list and write down 1 sentence on what I want it to do in the game

After the game, go through the list and tick any that I feel achieved their goal or I feel added value in general.

For the ones not ticked- 1 sentence on why they failed - was it mid-play by me, or did the unit just not work in the way I planned

For the ones ticked- 1 sentence on is there anything I could do to make them better.
