      "description": "Pain Abilities\nAll DRUKHARI units have a Pain ability, tagged with the word ‘Pain’. Pain abilities only apply to a unit while it is Empowered. If your Army Faction is DRUKHARI, you can Empower units from your army with Pain abilities by spending Pain tokens (see below).\nDesigner’s Note: You can also spend Pain tokens to activate additional effects in certain other rules such as Enhancements and Stratagems.\nGaining Pain Tokens\nIf your Army Faction is DRUKHARI, you gain Pain tokens as follows:\n• 1 Pain token at the start of your Command phase.\n• 1 Pain token each time an enemy unit is destroyed.\n• 1 Pain token each time an enemy unit fails a Battle-shock test.\nEach time you gain a Pain token, keep it to one side - this is your Pain token pool. Each time you spend a Pain token, reduce your Pain token pool by the same amount.\nEmpowered Through Pain\nEach Pain ability will state when you can spend Pain tokens to Empower that unit. When you do, until the end of the phase, that unit is Empowered and all Pain abilities it has take effect. While an Attached unit is Empowered, the Pain abilities of all Leader and Bodyguard units in that unit take effect - you do not need to spend additional Pain tokens to activate each of those Pain abilities.\nExample: At the start of your Charge phase, you spend 1 Pain token to Empower a unit of Wyches. The unit becomes Empowered, and so its Acrobatic Gladiators ability takes effect until the end of the phase. A Succubus is leading the unit, and so its Lithe Agility ability also takes effect until the end of the phase (no additional Pain token is required to activate that ability as well).",
      "flavorText": "The Drukhari feed on suffering and terror. Every arc of blood that jets from a blade-slit artery, every scream of agonised horror, every vertiginous moment of shock or despair experienced by their prey surges through the Drukhari like an intoxicant. As the battle rages, the denizens of the Dark City drink deep of the floodtide of pain. Sinews singing with stolen strength, motions blurred to preternatural swiftness, they howl in exhilarated bloodlust and fight all the harder to extract yet sweeter agonies from those who dare resist them."
