Each time such a unit reanimates a wound:\n• If that unit contains one or more models with fewer than their starting number of wounds remaining, select one of those models; that model regains one lost wound\n• If all models in that unit have their starting number of wounds, but that unit is not at its Starting Strength, one destroyed model is returned to that unit with one wound remaining.\nOnce such a unit is at its Starting Strength and all of its models have their starting number of wounds, nothing further happens.\nExample: A unit of Lokhust Destroyers (which have a Wounds characteristic of 3) activates its Reanimation Protocols. The unit had a Starting Strength of 3, but currently contains 2 models, and one of those models has lost 1 wound. A 3 is rolled to see how many wounds are reanimated. The first of these reanimated wounds restores the wounded Lokhust Destroyer back to 3 wounds. The second of these reanimated wounds returns the destroyed Lokhust Destroyer to the battlefield with 1 wound remaining. The third of these reanimated wounds restores one of the remaining lost wounds to the same Lokhust Destroyer that was just returned. The unit now contains 3 models, two of which have 3 wounds remaining and one of which has 2 wounds remaining.",

Should a Necron be slain, its body becomes wreathed in an eerie glow. Crawling limbs reattach. Sundered torsos and smashed skulls reform amidst emerald sparks. Witch lights flare back to life within dead eye-lenses and the Necron rises again, shambling back into their battle line. Those Necrons too catastrophically damaged to reform vanish instead, teleported away to their tombs for repair."
