You can continue re-rolling all of the dice in this manner, rolling one less D6 each time you do, until you are satisfied with the results rolled (or until you only have a single D6 remaining).\nWhen you are satisfied with the results rolled, those remaining dice become your Fate dice for the battle. These results cannot be changed or re-rolled further, unless a rule specifically states otherwise. Keep your Fate dice to one side – this is your Fate dice pool.\nOnce per phase, before making a dice roll for a model or unit from your army with the Strands of Fate ability, if you have one or more dice in your Fate dice pool, you can use one of those Fate dice. To do so, select one of those Fate dice to substitute that dice roll. The dice that is being substituted is not rolled; instead, the value of the selected Fate dice is used as if it had been rolled (this counts as an unmodified dice roll of that value for all rules purposes). Each Fate dice can only be used in this way once. After using a Fate dice, remove it from your Fate dice pool and roll all remaining dice that are part of that dice roll (if any). You can use Fate dice for any of the following types of dice roll:\n• Advance roll\n• Battle-shock test\n• Charge roll\n• Damage roll\n• Hit roll\n• Saving throw\n• Wound roll",
