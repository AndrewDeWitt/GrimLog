## SUBTERRANEAN ASSAULT

When the hive fleet's organisms descend, no place is truly safe from their wrath. As the lands swarm and writhe, and the skies are clouded with winged monstrosities, other foes advance unseen below. Mawlocs, Raveners and Trygons burst from the ground to emerge in the midst of clustered defenders, scything apart and devouring screaming victims before they can raise their weapons in defence, sowing crippling fear and confusion through those that witness the unexpected violence.

DETACHMENT RULE

## SURPRISE ASSAULT

Burrowing Tyranid bioforms burst from the ground in all their horror.

Each time a Tyranids model from your army makes an attack, re-roll a Hit roll of 1.

Each time a Burrower unit from your army is set up on the battlefield from Reserves, place a circular 40mm Tunnel Marker anywhere on the battlefield within 1" of that unit and more than 3" horizontally away from all enemy units.

In the Reinforcements step of your Movement phase, when you set up a unit on the battlefield from Reserves, you can set that unit up wholly within 9" of one of your Tunnel Markers and more than 6" horizontally away from any enemy units.

If an enemy model (excluding Aircraft) ends any kind of move within 3" of one of your Tunnel Markers, that Tunnel Marker is removed from the battlefield.

KEYWORDS

Mawloc and Trygon units from your army have the Burrower keyword.

In the Muster Armies step, you can select up to 2 Trygon models from your army. The selected units gain the Character keyword.

Designer’s Note: This means that the selected models can be given Enhancements and one of them can be selected as your Warlord.

ENHANCEMENTS

## SYNAPTIC STRATEGY

Possessing an exceptionally acute connection to the hive mind, this creature benefits from a constant influx of sensory data, enabling it to traverse the battlefield and emerge at the place and time of maximum impact.

Tyranids model only. Once per battle, you can target the bearer's unit with the Rapid Ingress stratagem for 0CP, and can do so even if you have already targeted a different unit with that Stratagem this phase.

## TREMOR SENSES

From its concealed position beneath the battlefield, this bioform picks up on subtle traces of movement from the enemy force, impelling its fellow organisms to reposition themselves in preparation for a coordinated assault.

Tyranids model only. After both players have deployed their armies, select up to three friendly Tyranids units from your army and redeploy them. When doing so, you can set those units up in Strategic Reserves, regardless of how many units are already in Strategic Reserves.

## VANGUARD INTELLECT

This bioform uses its own keen senses and predatory intellect to burrow into position and strike before the enemy can react.

Tyranids model with the Deep Strike ability only. The bearer's unit can be set up using the Deep Strike ability in the Reinforcements step of your first, second or third Movement phase, regardless of any mission rules.

## TRYGON PRIME

Only rarely manifested by the hive fleets, the Trygon Prime possesses a greatly enhanced synaptic network within its neural cortex, enabling it to more precisely coordinate the assaults of burrowing Tyranid creatures.

Trygon model only. The bearer gains the Synapse keyword. Improve the Strength and Weapon Skill characteristics of melee weapons equipped by the bearer by 1.

## ADAPTIVE OPTIMISATION (1CP)
SUBTERRANEAN ASSAULT — WARGEAR STRATAGEM

On occasions where subterranean assaults are deemed tactically useful, the hive mind may spontaneously alter its burrowing organisms, enabling them to act as beacons for its will.

WHEN: Command phase.
TARGET: One MAWLOC or TRYGON unit from your army.
EFFECT: Until the start of your next Command phase, your unit has the SYNAPSE keyword.

## REPLENISHING SWARMS (1CP)
SUBTERRANEAN ASSAULT — WARGEAR STRATAGEM

Scrambling through the tunnels come endless multitudes of warrior-beasts and harvester bioforms, spilling out of the depths to reinforce the teeming masses.

WHEN: Your Movement phase.
TARGET: One TYRANIDS unit from your army, wholly within 9" of one or more Tunnel Markers you placed.
EFFECT: One model in your unit regains up to D3+1 lost wounds, or you can return up to D3+1 destroyed models with a Wounds characteristic of 1 to your unit, with their full wounds remaining, instead.

## ENFILADING EMERGENCE (1CP)
SUBTERRANEAN ASSAULT — STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Emerging from the depths, Tyranid bioforms level their weapon morphs and spit hissing volleys of living ammunition into the exposed backs of outflanked prey.

WHEN: End of your Movement phase.
TARGET: One TYRANIDS unit from your army that was set up as Reinforcements this turn.
EFFECT: Until the end of your next Fight phase, weapons equipped by models in your unit have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] and [IGNORES COVER] abilities.

## TUNNEL NETWORK (1CP)
SUBTERRANEAN ASSAULT — STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Taking advantage of freshly burrowed tunnels, Tyranid bioforms move swiftly across the landscape, emerging in unexpected locations.

WHEN: End of your Movement phase.
TARGET: One TYRANIDS unit from your army that is wholly within 9" of one or more of your Tunnel Markers and not within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units.
EFFECT: Remove your unit from the battlefield and set it up again, wholly within 9" of another Tunnel Marker you placed, and more than 6" horizontally away from all enemy units.

## SWARMING ASSAULT (1CP)
SUBTERRANEAN ASSAULT — STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

A hive fleet's vanguard organisms favour mobility and aggression, keeping the foe on the back foot with repeated coordinated assaults.

WHEN: Your Charge phase.
TARGET: One TYRANIDS MONSTER unit from your army that was set up as Reinforcements this turn.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, friendly TYRANIDS units within 6" of your unit can re-roll Charge rolls.

## RETREAT BELOW (1CP)
SUBTERRANEAN ASSAULT — STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

The network of tunnels beneath the battlefield enables Tyranid organisms to retreat from the foe and prepare further ambushes.

WHEN: End of your opponent's Fight phase.
TARGET: One TYRANIDS unit or up to two BURROWER units from your army that are not within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units.
EFFECT: Remove your unit from the battlefield and place it into Strategic Reserves.

## WARRIOR BIOFORM ONSLAUGHT

None of the synapse-beasts comprising the hive fleets are more prevalent than Tyranid Warriors. Lethal killing machines in their own right, these bioforms serve not only as instruments of destruction but as relay nodes through which the will of the Hive Mind transmits. Armed with an array of devastating weaponised biomorphs, broods of Tyranid Warriors and other bioforms slaughter their way through any resistance and open a path for hordes of Hormagaunts and Termagants to pour in to obliterate all remaining resistance.

DETACHMENT RULE

## LEADER-BEASTS

Tyranid Warriors are adapted to shepherd the hive fleet's teeming swarms to war. Benefiting from heightened senses, hardened forms and great strength, they serve as ferocious beacons for and enforcers of the Hive Mind's indomitable will.

Tyranid Warriors (see below) and Winged Tyranid Prime units from your army have a 5+ invulnerable save.

KEYWORDS

Tyranid Warriors with Ranged Bio-weapons and Tyranid Warriors with Melee Bio-weapons units from your army gain the Tyranid Warriors and Battleline keywords, and while such a unit is not Battle-shocked, Tyranid Warriors models in that unit have an Objective Control characteristic of 3.

ENHANCEMENTS

## SYNAPTIC TYRANT

This Neurotyrant has been integrated into the synaptic web, maximising its control over the lesser bioforms and providing an additional layer of protection.

Neurotyrant model only. During the Declare Battle Formations step, the bearer can be attached to a Tyranid Warriors unit.

## OCULAR ADAPTATION

This node-beast's bio-adaptations allow it to perceive the minutest electrical impulse or heat signature. Few prey organisms escape its clutches.

Winged Tyranid Prime model only. Each time a model in the bearer's unit makes an attack, add 1 to the Hit roll.

## SENSORY ASSIMILATION

The Hive Mind feeds accumulated sensory data to this leader-beast, providing it with forewarning of incoming attacks long before the foe can land a blow.

Winged Tyranid Prime model only. Each time an attack targets the bearer's unit, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.

## ELEVATED MIGHT

This bioform and its accompanying organisms possess muscular adaptations that give them incredible speed and endurance.

Tyranids model only. The bearer's unit is eligible to declare a charge in a turn in which it Advanced.

## SYNAPTIC AMPLIFICATION (1CP)
WARRIOR BIOFORM ONSLAUGHT - STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Tyranid Warriors focus and amplify the urgency of the Hive Mind's impulse to nearby broods, lending them increased coordination.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the Fight phase.

TARGET: One Tyranids unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot or fight this phase.

EFFECT: If that unit is a Tyranid Warriors unit, select up to one Endless Multitude unit from your army, that is not Battle-shocked, within 6" of it. Until the end of the phase, each time a model in those units makes an attack, re-roll a Wound roll of 1, and, if it is a Tyranid Warriors unit, re-roll a Hit roll of 1 as well.

## SYNAPTIC MICRONODES (1CP)
WARRIOR BIOFORM ONSLAUGHT - STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Impulses from the Hive Mind compel its most adaptable bioforms to shed microbial micronodes that burrow into the soil, knitting together to form a short-term synaptic relay that persists only as long as the brief-burning lifespans of its composite creatures.

WHEN: Your Movement phase.

TARGET: One Tyranid Warriors unit from your army.

EFFECT: Select one objective marker you control that your unit is within range of. That objective marker remains under your control until your opponent's Level of Control over that objective marker is greater than yours at the end of a phase.

## SPONTANEOUS HYPERCORROSION (1CP)
WARRIOR BIOFORM ONSLAUGHT - WARGEAR STRATAGEM

Biomorphic symbiotes growing beneath the chitinous plates of some Tyranids can be activated by synaptic impulse, acidifying their bio-weapons at a moment's notice.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the Fight phase.

TARGET: One Tyranids unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot or fight this phase.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, add 2 to the Strength characteristic of ranged weapons equipped by models in your unit and add 1 to the Strength characteristic of melee weapons equipped by Tyranid Warriors and Winged Tyranid Prime models in your unit.

## PARASITIC PAYLOAD (1CP)
WARRIOR BIOFORM ONSLAUGHT - STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

The projectiles fired by this weapon are infected with parasites that burrow into the central nervous systems of their targets, causing them to wail and scream in pain and giving away their position to the oncoming swarms.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.

TARGET: One Tyranid Warriors with Ranged Bio-weapons unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot this phase.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, ranged weapons equipped by models in your unit have the [IGNORES COVER] ability. After your unit has resolved its shooting attacks this phase, select one enemy unit hit by one or more of those attacks. Until the end of the turn, models in that unit cannot have the Benefit of Cover.

## RESTORATIVE IMPULSE (1CP)
WARRIOR BIOFORM ONSLAUGHT - STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Responding to impulses from the Hive Mind, dormant nanoviral organisms awaken within the corpse of a fallen Tyranid Warrior, knitting together ruptured organs and restoring its broken form to life.

WHEN: Your Command phase.

TARGET: One Tyranid Warriors unit from your army that is below its Starting Strength.

EFFECT: Return 1 destroyed model (excluding Character models) to your unit.

## SYNAPTIC SHIELD (1CP)
WARRIOR BIOFORM ONSLAUGHT - STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

By focusing the psionic energies of the Hive Mind, these leader-beasts shield the teeming bioforms under their command.

WHEN: Your opponent's Shooting phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.

TARGET: One Tyranid Warriors unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit's attacks.

EFFECT: If that unit is a Tyranid Warriors unit, select up to one Endless Multitude unit from your army, that is not Battle-shocked, within 6" of it. Until the end of the phase, each time a ranged attack targets one of those units, if the Strength characteristic of that attack is greater than the Toughness characteristic of that unit, subtract 1 from the Wound roll.

## UPDATES & ERRATA

Page 72 – Vanguard Onslaught, Neuronode Enhancement
Change to:
'TYRANIDS model only. After both players have deployed their armies, you can select up to three Vanguard Invader units from your army and redeploy all of those units. When doing so, any of those units can be placed into Strategic Reserves, regardless of how many units are already in Strategic Reserves.'

Page 73 – Surprise Assault Stratagem
Change to:
'WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after a Vanguard Invader unit from your army has selected its targets.
TARGET: That Vanguard Invader unit.
EFFECT: Select one enemy unit that was selected as the target of one or more of your unit's attacks. That enemy unit must take a Battle-shock test. Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit makes an attack that targets that enemy unit, add 1 to the Hit roll. If the Battle-shock test was failed, add 1 to the Wound roll as well.'

Page 83 – The Swarmlord, Abilities, Malign Presence
Change to:
'Malign Presence (Aura): If this model is your WARLORD, each time your opponent targets a unit from their army with a Stratagem, if that unit is within 12" of this model, increase the cost of that use of that Stratagem by 1CP.

Designer’s Note: This ability takes precedence over the Lord of Deceit ability presented in the Balance Dataslate June 2024.'

## FAQS

Q: While using the Subterranean Assault Detachment, does a Mawloc’s Terror from the Deep ability trigger when arriving via a Tunnel Marker?
A: No.

Q: What is the effect of the Unseen Lurkers Stratagem with respect to the Balance Dataslate ruling on Stratagems that prevent units from being targeted?
A: The effect of the Unseen Lurkers Stratagem becomes:
'EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, your unit can only be selected as the target of a ranged attack if the attacking model is within 18" or, if your unit has the Lone Operative ability, if the attacking model is within 6". Your opponent can select new targets for the attacking unit's attacks.'

Q: Do units that are repositioned by rules that do not specify that the unit being repositioned is first placed into Reserves (e.g. the Grey Knights Teleport Assault rule) need to take a Battle-shock test on a roll of 2+ if a Tyranids Character with the Hunting Grounds Enhancement is on the battlefield?
A: Yes. Rules that are triggered by or apply to Reserves units are also triggered by and apply to a repositioned unit when it is set back up.

Q: Can I use the Rapid Regeneration Stratagem when an ability like Doombolt or Vortex of Doom would inflict mortal wounds on a Tyranids unit from my army?
A: No.

Q: When resolving a Mawloc's Terror From the Deep ability, which units need to take a Battle-shock test: every unit within 12" of the Mawloc, or only those units for which a 5+ was rolled when resolving that ability?
A: Only those units for which a 5+ was rolled.

Q: If my opponent uses a rule to place a unit into Strategic Reserves during the first battle round, and that rule states that the unit must arrive on the battlefield in the next battle round, what happens if a model from my army uses the Psychostatic Disruption Enhancement in the second battle round when that enemy Strategic Reserves unit is due to arrive?
A: The 'cannot arrive' rule takes precedence over the rule stating that the unit 'must arrive' from Strategic Reserves. Roll one D6: on a 4+, that enemy unit cannot arrive on the battlefield this turn.

Q: If I select a unit of Neurogaunts for a Neurotyrant's Neuroloids ability that is not led by a Synapse unit, does that unit of Neurogaunts gain the Synapse keyword?
A: No.

Q: When using the Reclaim Biomass Stratagem, can the Stratagem effect be used on the unit that was just destroyed?
A: No.

---

## Q: Does an Attached unit containing a Hive Tyrant and Tyrant Guard receive the Stealth ability from a Venomthrope's Foul Spores ability?
A: No. The unit has the MONSTER keyword and the ability excludes MONSTERS.

## Q: Are Spore Mines units that are added to an army during a battle restricted by abilities that prevent Reserves from being set up within a certain range (e.g. Space Marines Infiltrators' Omniscramblers)?
A: No.

## Q: Do rules such as the Insurmountable Odds Detachment rule and the Carnifexes' Blistering Assault ability let me choose between not moving the unit in question or moving the unit as far as possible following the conditions?
A: Yes.

## Q: If I roll one D6 for a Carnifexes unit's Blistering Assault move and then choose not to move the models, do they still count as having made a Blistering Assault move that phase?
A: Yes, they have made a Blistering Assault move of 0".

## Q: When a Carnifex model makes a Blistering Assault move or an Endless Multitude model makes a Surge move, does that model have to move the full amount allowed by the dice result?
A: No, it can move any distance up to that allowed distance.

## Q: Does a unit affected by the Psychostatic Disruption Enhancement have to arrive from Reserves in the next Movement phase?
A: No.

## Q: Does the Synaptic Goading Stratagem allow a unit to leave Engagement Range and move towards the closest objective marker?
A: Yes.

## Q: Can units targeted by the Shadow in the Warp army rule use the Insane Bravery Stratagem?
A: No. Insane Bravery can only be used in your Command phase.

## SCYTHED HIERODULE

The Hive Mind trusts only in the power of flesh. The Hierodule is a clear embodiment of this principle, a living weapon of monstrous power whose scythed limbs can cut apart war machines with ease. Any that survive the power of its talons are subjected to torrents of mutagenic acid from the symbiote-beast that grows between its armoured plates.
