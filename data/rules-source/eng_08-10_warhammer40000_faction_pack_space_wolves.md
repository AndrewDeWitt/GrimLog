## CHAMPIONS OF FENRIS

The Champions of Fenris give vent to blood-chilling howls as they storm into battle. They are the hand-picked warriors of Great Wolf Logan Grimnar, the exemplars of all that it means to be a Space Wolf, and every last one of them fights to prove themselves worthy of such accolades. Even should they do battle without their lord at their head, still they strive as though he was watching and judging their every effort. They commit one saga-worthy deed after another. They hunt down and lay low the mightiest prey. They conquer seemingly impossible odds, employing their veteran skill and cunning to its fullest extent and winning victories worthy of celebration in feast and song. On worlds across the galaxy, no matter how terrible the foe or deadly the battlefield, the champions of Fenris fight endlessly in defence of the Allfather's realm.

DETACHMENT RULE

## THE GREAT WOLF WATCHES

The battle-brothers of this Great Company know what their lord expects of them and would rather die a thousand deaths than be found wanting in Grimnar's eyes.

At the end of your opponent's Charge phase, each ADEPTUS ASTARTES INFANTRY and ADEPTUS ASTARTES WALKER unit from your army that is within 3" of one or more enemy units and would be eligible to declare a charge against one or more of those units can declare a charge against one or more of those units, and you resolve that charge as if it were your Charge phase. If that charge is successful, your unit does not receive any Charge bonus this turn.

While ADEPTUS ASTARTES TERMINATOR units from your army are not Battle-shocked, add 1 to the Objective Control characteristic of models in those units.

RESTRICTIONS

Your army can include SPACE WOLVES units, but it cannot include any ADEPTUS ASTARTES units drawn from any other Chapter.

ENHANCEMENTS

## WOLVES' WISDOM

This champion has honed his killer instincts over endless years of bloody battle through wildly varying landscapes and against every manner of foe imaginable. He knows unerringly where and when to land the killing blow.

ADEPTUS ASTARTES INFANTRY model only. The bearer's unit can declare a charge against one or more units within 6" instead of within 3" when using The Great Wolf Watches Detachment rule.

## FOES' FATE

The skjalds tell in hushed voices how this warrior was born beneath a blood-omen moon, how his fate is interwoven with those of his prey-to-be and how he waits now at the end of each such enemy's thread, the final and inescapable executor of their deaths.

ADEPTUS ASTARTES TERMINATOR model only. Each time an enemy unit (excluding MONSTERS and VEHICLES) within Engagement Range of the bearer's unit Falls Back, all models in that enemy unit must take Desperate Escape tests. When doing so, if that enemy unit is Battle-shocked, subtract 1 from each of those tests.

## FANGRUNE PENDANT

The fangs strung upon this adamantine thread belonged to the eldest and most cunning Fenrisian wolves. They are graven with runes of wisdom and guile, which are said to enhance the wearer's own further.

ADEPTUS ASTARTES TERMINATOR model only. The bearer's unit is eligible to shoot and declare a charge in a turn in which it Fell Back.

## LONGSTRIDER

This champion is renowned amongst their battle-brothers for their relentless pace when on the hunt, their loping strides eating up the miles as they run the foe to ground.

ADEPTUS ASTARTES model only. You can re-roll Charge rolls made for the bearer's unit.

## PREYTAKER'S EYE (1CP)

CHAMPIONS OF FENRIS — STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Long and bloody experience has taught these warriors how best to identify the slightest weakness in their prey and exploit it to the fullest.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the Fight phase.

TARGET: One ADEPTUS ASTARTES INFANTRY unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot or fight this phase.

EFFECT: Select either the [LETHAL HITS] or [SUSTAINED HITS 1] abilities. Until the end of the phase, weapons equipped by models in your unit have that ability.

## ARMOUR OF CONTEMPT (1CP)

CHAMPIONS OF FENRIS — STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

The belligerence and transhuman physiologies of the Adeptus Astartes make them unyielding foes.

WHEN: Your opponent's Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.

TARGET: One ADEPTUS ASTARTES unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit's attacks.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each time an attack targets your unit, worsen the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.

## RUNES OF CLAIMING (1CP)

CHAMPIONS OF FENRIS — STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

A few quick cuts with a diamond‑keen hunting knife or energised claw tip leave Fenrisian runes carved into bedrock, plasteel or flesh, marks of abjuration against the foe and secret messages between Space Wolves alike.

WHEN: End of your Command phase.

TARGET: One ADEPTUS ASTARTES INFANTRY or ADEPTUS ASTARTES WALKER unit from your army.

EFFECT: Select one objective marker you control that your unit is within range of. That objective marker remains under your control until your opponent's Level of Control over that objective marker is greater than yours at the end of a phase.

## CHILLING HOWL (1CP)

CHAMPIONS OF FENRIS — STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Raising their feral voices as one, the elite champions of Fenris give voice to a predatory howl fit to freeze the marrow of the bravest warriors.

WHEN: Your opponent's Command phase.

TARGET: One ADEPTUS ASTARTES TERMINATOR unit from your army.

EFFECT: Each enemy unit within 6" of your unit must take a Battle‑shock test, subtracting 1 from that test if that unit is Below Half‑strength.

## STALKING WOLVES (1CP)

CHAMPIONS OF FENRIS — STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

These veteran warriors approach the foe like wolves on the hunt. They are ever‑poised to drop into cover or fade into the shadows to avoid their prey's increasingly desperate attempts to drive them off.

WHEN: Your opponent's Shooting phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.

TARGET: One ADEPTUS ASTARTES INFANTRY unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit's attacks.

EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, models in your unit have the Stealth ability.

## ONRUSHING STORM (1CP)

CHAMPIONS OF FENRIS — STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

A Fenrisian gunship skims low over the battlefield, touching down just long enough for these elite warriors to embark before it lifts off again. The enemy's respite will not last long; it will return with its deadly cargo soon enough.

WHEN: End of your opponent's Fight phase.

TARGET: One ADEPTUS ASTARTES TERMINATOR unit from your army that is not within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units.

EFFECT: Remove your unit from the battlefield and place it into Strategic Reserves.
