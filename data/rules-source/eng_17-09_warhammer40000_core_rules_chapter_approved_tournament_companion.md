## WARHAMMER 40,000

## CHAPTER APPROVED TOURNAMENT COMPANION (VERSION 1.2)

## INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the Chapter Approved Tournament Companion!
The following guidelines are designed to support organisers of Warhammer 40,000 events in delivering a fine-tuned tournament experience using the Chapter Approved Mission Deck. That product offers great scope for all kinds of matched play, and its many variables create a dizzying array of potential missions – thousands, in fact! Some of these are particularly well suited to the most hotly contested scenarios, and this pack provides suggestions for the best event configurations. We have also taken the opportunity to optimise certain Core Rules concepts for tournament play.

This document provides a ready-made framework for levelling the playing field and getting games underway quickly, whether you are planning your first matched play event or have years of experience organising the largest and most acclaimed tournaments. Its recommendations will be followed in full at most Games Workshop matched play events, and are considered the official way to play Warhammer 40,000 in a tournament setting, but can be adapted to suit your own circumstances – the terrain layout advice is aimed primarily at newer organisers, for example, and those with large established terrain collections should feel free to interpret it accordingly.

The recommendations are presented as follows:

- Chapter Approved Tournament Mission Sequence: Adjustments to the steps players would normally follow to generate a mission and prepare the battlefield.
- Chapter Approved Mission Deck Errata & FAQ: Updates to certain cards and answers to frequently asked questions.
- Chapter Approved Tournament Mission Pool: 20 recommended tournament rounds to draw from, with pre-set Primary Missions and deployment modes that put all players on an equal footing and minimise pre-game admin.
- Terrain Layouts: A suite of carefully designed terrain setups to be used in conjunction with the Chapter Approved Tournament Mission Pool.
- Pairings and Rankings: Advice for fairly pairing players and determining rankings.

Designer’s Note: This document does not use the full contents of your Chapter Approved Mission Deck; it has been written to provide the best experience for strangers to play a pick-up game or face off in an event. For this reason we have not included the Asymmetric War cards, the Twist cards or the Challenger cards, which are left for pick-up-and-play games where you can plan and prepare. In addition, this document assumes you will be playing Strike Force sized games; as such, the layouts are designed to be used with the Strike Force Deployment cards. We recommend that tournament organisers who wish to run an Incursion event should adjust these layouts as appropriate.

## CHAPTER APPROVED TOURNAMENT MISSION SEQUENCE
A Chapter Approved Tournament Mission battle is waged by following the sequence below.

## 1 MUSTER ARMIES
Muster armies as described in the Core Rules.

### INCURSION MISSIONS
In an Incursion mission, we suggest the following changes to the Muster Armies rules for a better experience for both players.

- Your army can contain up to two units with each datasheet name – or up to four units with each datasheet name if it is a BATTLELINE or DEDICATED TRANSPORT unit.
- Your army can contain up to one TITANIC CHARACTER.

## 2 DETERMINE MISSION
Instead of shuffling and drawing from the Deployment and Primary Mission decks, players should use the pre-generated missions from the Chapter Approved Tournament Mission Pool. Set aside the Secondary Mission cards deck as normal (players will receive these later).

## 3 READ MISSION
Read the Primary Mission. The Primary Mission card details how and when you score Victory points (VP), and may also apply additional conditions to the battle.

You can also score VP by achieving Secondary Missions (described later). Twist cards and Challenger cards will not be used.

## 4 PLACE OBJECTIVE MARKERS
Players now set up objective markers on the battlefield. Each Deployment card’s deployment map will show players how many objective markers to set up and where each should be placed. In Chapter Approved Tournament Missions, models can end any type of move on top of an objective marker.

Designer’s Note: In the Warhammer 40,000 Core Rules, objective markers are physical artefacts that models cannot end a move on, representing vital data caches, xenos relics, Chaos portals or anything else that suits your narrative. While this adds to the cinematic nature of the battlefield and offers exciting hobby opportunities, it can sometimes result in model-positioning circumstances that not everyone will enjoy equally. As such, these guidelines recommend treating objective markers as flat, circular markers 40mm in diameter that offer no impediment to the movement or placement of models.

## 5 CREATE THE BATTLEFIELD
Players now create the battlefield and set up terrain features. Missions are played on rectangular battlefields whose dimensions are approximately 44" by 60". When setting up terrain features, use the guidelines detailed in the Terrain Layouts section of this pack. Players must use the rules for terrain features detailed in the Core Rules. While other approaches to terrain layout may work within the collections of experienced organisers, we recommend these terrain guidelines when otherwise in doubt.

## 6 DETERMINE ATTACKER AND DEFENDER
Look at the Deployment card drawn and agree which edges of your battlefield are the Attacker’s and Defender’s battlefield edges. Roll off: the winner decides who will be the Attacker and who will be the Defender.

## 7 SELECT SECONDARY MISSIONS
Secondary Mission cards detail additional ways to score VP, and must be used either as Fixed or Tactical Missions. Players now secretly note down whether they will use Fixed or Tactical Missions; if using Fixed Missions, they must also note down which two Fixed Missions they will use (see below). Players then reveal these decisions and proceed accordingly.

FIXED MISSIONS

Fixed Missions are goals that remain throughout the battle, and can be achieved multiple times.

Fixed Missions are those marked with the symbol shown on the left. After revealing the two Fixed Missions you will use, set aside the remainder of your Secondary Mission deck (it will not be needed during the battle). Your selected Fixed Mission cards cannot be discarded for any reason (unless you are using the Adapt or Die Twist card).

TACTICAL MISSIONS

Tactical Missions are replenished at the start of your Command phase, and are discarded once achieved.

After revealing that you will use Tactical Missions, shuffle your Secondary Mission deck.

If you are using Tactical Missions:

■ At the start of your first Command phase, draw two cards from your Secondary Mission deck; those two Secondary Mission cards are active for you until you achieve them. At the start of each of your subsequent Command phases, if you have fewer than two active Secondary Mission cards, draw from your Secondary Mission deck until you have two active Secondary Mission cards.
■ At the end of your Command phase, you can spend CP to use the New Orders Stratagem (see right).

## NEW ORDERS
CORE - STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

High command has received new intelligence

(1CP)

WHEN: End of your Command phase.
TARGET: One of your active Secondary Mission cards.
EFFECT: Discard it and draw one new Secondary Mission card.

At the end of each player’s turn, each player using Tactical Missions does the following, starting with the player whose turn it is:

■ First, if you scored 1 or more VP from a Secondary Mission card, discard that Secondary Mission card – it is achieved.
■ Then, you can discard one or more of your active Secondary Mission cards. If you do, and it is your turn, you gain 1CP.
■ If your Secondary Mission deck runs out, you cannot generate any additional Secondary Missions during the battle.

## 8 DECLARE BATTLE FORMATIONS
Players secretly note down which of their Leader units will start the battle attached to which Bodyguard units, which of their units will start the battle embarked within which TRANSPORTS, and which of their units will start the battle in Reserves (including Strategic Reserves). Players then reveal these decisions.

RESERVES RESTRICTIONS

■ No more than half of the units in your army can start the battle in Reserves, and the points total of those units cannot be more than half of the points total of your army (units embarked within a TRANSPORT that is set up in Reserves also count towards these limits).
■ Reserves units cannot arrive on the battlefield during the first battle round (excluding units placed into Strategic Reserves during the battle).
■ Any Reserves units that have not arrived on the battlefield by the end of the third battle round count as having been destroyed, as do any units embarked within them (excluding units placed into Strategic Reserves during the battle).

## 9 DEPLOY ARMIES
Players take it in turns to set up their remaining units one at a time, starting with the Defender. A player’s models must be set up wholly within their deployment zone. If a player sets up a TITANIC unit when it is their turn to set up a unit, they skip their next turn to set up a unit. If one player finishes deploying all of their units, their opponent then deploys the remainder of their units.

## 10 REDEPLOY UNITS
Some rules allow players to redeploy certain units after both armies are deployed. Unless otherwise stated, such rules are resolved in this step. Players alternate resolving any such rules, starting with the Attacker.

## 11 DETERMINE FIRST TURN
Roll off: the winner takes the first turn.

## 12 RESOLVE PRE-BATTLE RULES
Players alternate resolving any pre-battle rules units from their army may have, starting with the player who will take the first turn.

2

---

## BEGIN THE BATTLE
13
The first battle round begins. Players continue to resolve battle rounds until the battle ends.

## END THE BATTLE
14
The battle ends after five battle rounds have been completed. Even if one player has no models remaining in their army at the start of their turn, players continue to play out their turns until the battle ends.

## DETERMINE VICTOR
15
At the end of the battle, the player with the most VP is the winner. If the players are tied, the battle is a draw.

The maximum VP each player can score is 100VP. Each player scores 10VP if their army is painted to a Battle Ready standard. The maximum VP that can be scored from each source of VP is detailed on below. In all cases, any excess VP awarded above these maximums are lost.

VP SOURCE                 MAXIMUM VP
Primary Mission           50VP     90VP
Secondary Missions        40VP*    90VP
Battle Ready Army         10VP     10VP

* If using Fixed Missions, 20VP maximum per Fixed Mission card.

## DESIGNER'S NOTES

### VP FOR DESTROYING MODELS OR UNITS
Some cards award VP for destroying enemy models or units. If you gain VP as described on such cards, you retain those VP even if those destroyed models or units are subsequently returned to the battlefield.

### VP UP TO A LIMIT
Some cards award VP up to a stated limit, which may not be a round multiple, e.g. '2VP (up to 5VP)'. In such cases, you can keep scoring up to the stated limit, then any excess VP awarded are lost.

### DISCARDING CARDS
Some cards begin with a section named 'When Drawn', which details immediate next steps including when such cards either can or must be discarded. Note that if such a card is a Secondary Mission card, this section only applies if you are using Tactical Missions.

### HOW MANY UNITS CAN PERFORM THE SAME ACTION?
If an Action's Units section places a limit on the number of units that can perform it, this means that only that number of units from your army can be performing that Action at any one time.

## ACTIONS

Your forces can attempt daring battlefield tasks to turn the conflict in your favour.

Some cards feature Actions that certain units can perform. Each Action states which units can perform it, when it is started and completed, and what the effects of completing it are.

A unit cannot start to perform an Action if one or more of the following apply to that unit:

- It is an AIRCRAFT unit.
- It is Battle-shocked.
- It has an Objective Control characteristic of 0.
- It is within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units (unless it is a TITANIC CHARACTER unit).
- It Advanced or Fell Back this turn.
- It is not eligible to shoot this phase (including units that have already been selected to shoot this phase).

If a unit starts to perform an Action, until that Action is completed or until the end of the turn (whichever is later), that unit is not eligible to shoot or declare a charge (if it is a TITANIC CHARACTER unit, that unit cannot start to perform another Action and is not eligible to declare a charge instead).

If a unit performing an Action makes a move (excluding Pile-in and Consolidation moves) or leaves the battlefield, that Action cannot be completed.

## CHAPTER APPROVED MISSION DECK: FAQS

Questions about the Chapter Approved Mission Deck will be reviewed periodically and answered below. Newly added entries are marked in red.

Q: If I destroy the Bodyguard unit of an Attached unit that meets the criteria for Cull the Horde (Starting Strength of 13+), but the Leader unit survives, do I score the VP for destroying the Bodyguard unit?
A: If the Bodyguard unit would have had a Starting Strength of 13+ had it not been part of an Attached unit, then yes. Otherwise, no.

Example: If you destroy a unit of 16 Accursed Cultists, but their Cultist Firebrand Leader survives, you score the VP for that unit. If you destroy a 10‑strong Cultist Mob, but don't destroy the Dark Commune attached to them, you do not score the VP for that unit.

Q: If a unit that is part of an Attached unit is destroyed, and that Attached unit was performing an Action, can the remaining unit(s) in that Attached unit still complete that Action?
A: Yes.

Q: If my opponent selects an Attached unit for the Marked for Death Secondary Mission, which units forming that Attached unit must I destroy to score VP?
A: To score VP, you must destroy the Bodyguard unit and at least one of the Leader units that was attached to it. For example, if your opponent selects a unit of Boyz led by a Warboss and a Weirdboy, and you destroy that Boyz unit so that the Warboss and Weirdboy each become individual units, you must also destroy either that Warboss or that Weirdboy (or one of them must be removed from the battlefield for any other reason) to score VP from Marked for Death.

Q: When selecting units for the Marked for Death Secondary Mission, can I select a Leader within an Attached unit?
A: No.

Q: When performing the Terraform Action, can I terraform an objective marker my opponent has already terraformed?
A: Yes.

Q: In the Burden of Trust Primary Mission, how many times can each player score VP for guarding an objective marker they control?
A: The player going first can score VP for guarding an objective marker they control at the end of their opponent's first, second, third, fourth and fifth turn. The player going second can score VP for guarding an objective marker they control at the end of their opponent's second, third, fourth and fifth turn.

Q: When setting up objective markers as part of step 4 of the Chapter Approved Tournament Mission Sequence, or setting up a new objective marker as part of a Primary Mission (such as The Ritual), do I measure from/to the centre or the edge of the objective marker?
A: In all of these instances, you measure from the centre of the objective marker. This also includes the central objective marker in the Search and Destroy deployment map when measuring the boundaries of the deployment zones.

Q: To start performing the Sabotage Action, does it require both the terrain feature and your unit to not be within your deployment zone? Or is it just your unit that must not be within your deployment zone?
A: Only your unit must not be within your deployment zone to start performing the Sabotage Action.

Q: In Burden of Trust, can you guard objective markers in your own deployment zone?
A: Yes.

Q: If I Terraform an objective in my opponent's deployment zone, can my opponent Terraform that objective back?
A: No, as a player can't perform the Terraform action on an objective marker within their deployment zone.

Q: If I complete the Terraform action on an objective that was Terraformed by my opponent, is the objective now Terraformed by me?
A: Yes.

Q: For Primary and Secondary Missions that award VP for destroying CHARACTER models or units, if those models or units are returned to the battlefield and then subsequently destroyed again, will such Primary and Secondary Missions award VP for them being destroyed again?
A: Yes, unless that Primary or Secondary Mission specifies otherwise.

Q: For the purposes of the Mission Pack, are there any amendments to the Core Rules regarding how Ruins affect charging units and which models can fight?
A: No. This means models can be positioned to make it difficult to charge directly through sections of terrain features into combat, as models can't end their Charge move where any part of their model or base would be within sections of those terrain features (e.g. a solid Ruins wall). This may mean the result of a Charge roll needs to be greater to allow a unit to make a Charge move that ends within Engagement Range and not within any sections of those terrain features, while still following all other conditions of charging.

Designer's Note: Organisers, if your terrain collection includes large enclosed structures that units would be able to move within, but may render ending a Charge move within Engagement Range of those units within that terrain impossible, you may wish to include additional clarification for your particular terrain elements within your event packs to avoid uninteractive situations.

## CHAPTER APPROVED TOURNAMENT MISSION POOL

The 20 Chapter Approved Tournament Missions in this section are designed to act as a pool from which organisers can build their events, selecting from it in random order. Further commentary on these is given below.

## PRIMARY MISSIONS

The Chapter Approved Mission Deck includes 10 Primary Missions, for the best balanced experience we have used a mix of 7 of these Primary Missions for organisers to build their events. We recommend selecting options that span a variety of different Primary Missions, to provide different challenges for the players to adapt to.

For those running longer-format events, or whose attendees are particularly expectant of a perfectly balanced mission every time, we have included the more straightforward Primary Missions in a greater number of configurations.

## RECOMMENDED TERRAIN LAYOUTS

When using the recommended terrain layouts in this pack, please note the layouts best suited for each deployment mode, as shown in the table below. We recommend structuring your mission order to facilitate any changes to terrain layouts you will need to make during your event, if, as the organiser, you choose to set up the tables for the players.

## TERRAIN LAYOUTS

The following battlefield recommendations are intended primarily for newer organisers and those looking for a steer in building up a terrain collection for regular tournament play. These layouts will be seen at most Games Workshop matched play events, and reflect the type of terrain density that creates risk-and-reward decisions that a wide variety of army types can engage with. They are by no means the only way to set up a battlefield for balanced play, but represent a reliable starting point when in doubt.

These are the terrain layouts we use for balance and internal testing within the Warhammer Design Studio. We feel they reflect how a battlefield should look for balanced play in the current edition of Warhammer 40,000.

They are by no means the only way to set up a battlefield for balanced play, but represent a reliable starting point when in doubt. These layouts were designed with a few key principles in mind:

## RECOMMENDED MEASUREMENTS

For all of the battlefield recommendations we use a combination of three different sizes of area terrain outlines:

AREA TERRAIN SIZE     QUANTITY
6" x 4"               4
10" x 5"              2
12" x 6"              6

Using the area terrain outlines detailed above, all of the battlefield recommendations have preset measurements provided. This allows for organisers to easily set up the tables, or allow the players themselves to set up their own tables at the beginning of each round.

## OBJECTIVE MARKERS

Objective markers can and sometimes will be either hidden within terrain or placed in the open.

## USE OF RUINS

The following layouts primarily use the Ruins terrain feature. This efficiently achieves a good amount of line-of-sight blockage and cover appropriate for balanced games, thanks to the natural abstraction of line of sight within the rules for Ruins. Remember that a variety of terrain heights not only adds to the immersive nature of the battlefield, but is also important for line of sight and rules such as Plunging Fire. For organisers and players with a more robust terrain collection (especially elements that block true line of sight), incorporating features such as Woods, Barricades and Hills into your chosen layouts is perfectly acceptable.

## TERRAIN KEY - SUGGESTED TERRAIN HEIGHT

MORE THAN 4"      2" OR LESS

For model mobility purposes, we have shaded the area terrain outlines in the above colours to show our recommendations for how tall the terrain should be in each section.

Below are examples of Ruins terrain placements within area terrain sections, as well as icons that denote if connected area terrain outlines are a single area terrain section or separate area terrain sections when determining line of sight.

These height and Ruin placement guidelines help provide a balanced tournament experience; as organisers you are free to adjust this to suit your terrain collection.

SINGLE AREA TERRAIN SECTION

SEPARATE AREA TERRAIN SECTIONS

## PAIRINGS AND RANKINGS

There are countless different ways in which a Warhammer organised play event can be run. While broad-stroke concepts like pairing off players with the same record are straightforward enough, the nuance of running a successful Warhammer tournament is the subject of continuous conversation and evolution. The following recommendations are once again for newer organisers who are still establishing their principles and best practices, to help improve the average experience at any Warhammer tournament. These principles are also followed at most official Games Workshop events, and are designed to create the fairest, most fun experience possible for every attendee, regardless of standing.

## PAIRING PLAYERS

While the first round of most tournaments is randomly paired, subsequent round pairing can be done in a number of ways. The first pairing metric will almost always be player record, i.e. pairing a 3-1 player with another 3-1 player, and so on. Given that most rounds will include numerous players with the same record, however, deciding pairings beyond this metric can be quite nuanced, and the different methods available can have significant impacts on the experience of players at an event. We recommend pairing players by the following criteria:

■ First – by record (i.e. the number of wins, losses and draws)  
■ Second – by win path (i.e. the timing of the rounds in which a player won or lost their games)  
■ Third – randomly within players of the same ranking

### Win Path

A player's ‘win path’ refers not to their number of wins and losses, but to the timing of those wins and losses. While pairing by win path has an incidental tendency to pair people by strength of schedule, its greatest impact is on the overall enjoyment experienced by all players, as it tends to pair players based upon shared experience.

For example, let’s take two 3-1 players. One of them lost their first game; they likely lowered their expectations for winning the whole event after this, but are probably in a great mood after three consecutive victories. The other won their first three games then lost their fourth – a sharp disappointment after a 3-0 start. Should these players face off, their shared enjoyment may be at odds as they are in very different emotional places. Win path ensures players enter their match with recent common experiences upon which to build a friendship during their next game of Warhammer.

## RANKING PLAYERS

In many tournaments, the overall Best General will be the single remaining undefeated player at the end of the event. Sometimes, however, there are not enough rounds available to determine a single undefeated player, and players often wish to know their ranking regardless of whether they won the whole event. To help break ties between players who end an event with the same record, we recommend ranking players by the following criteria:

■ First – by overall record (wins, losses and draws)  
■ Second – by their opponents' win records (i.e. those with more wins against opponents with better win records would place higher)  
■ Third – by total Victory points (VP)

Designer’s Note: Traditionally, many organisers use total VP or VP differential to determine ranking. However, the number of VP scored within any one game of Warhammer 40,000 rarely tells a clear story about how close that game actually was. Often, a more challenging opponent will be harder to score against (and thus yield a lower score despite the victory being all the more hard-earned), or the nature of how the two armies match up may dictate a risky strategy that doesn’t pay off (and thus yield a wide score disparity despite almost working out).

As such, we do not recommend using VP as a pairing metric, nor as a ranking metric until all other metrics have been exhausted, or when further tie-breaking is required (e.g. in larger events where identical rankings become more likely). By contrast, opponent win record is an ideal metric, because when two players end up with the same record, the overall skill of their opponents is a better indicator of which player had the more challenging path along the way.

## The Rules Commentary, Errata and FAQ

There are myriad ways to enjoy the Warhammer hobby, and these all manifest themselves at a tournament: gifted hobbyists with beautiful armies, skilled competitors aiming for Best General, casual players looking to face new opponents and make new friends (by far the most common type of attendee), and even practitioners of the niche hobby of Rules Lawyer! These particular hobbyists often find unusual rules interactions at the very fringes of Warhammer 40,000, which can create interesting challenges for tournament organisers looking to provide clear answers and an easy gaming experience for their attendees. For the current edition, the Warhammer Design Studio has created its most robust and comprehensive Rules Commentary, Errata and FAQ to date. Available to download on warhammer-community.com, these living documents will be reviewed periodically to clarify any issues that may be causing uncertainty. Should an odd rules interaction come up during your event and the Core Rules do not provide a clear answer, we recommend consulting these resources.
