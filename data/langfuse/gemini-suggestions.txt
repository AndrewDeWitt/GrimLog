User will pick ONE option that fits their collection.\n\n## SUGGESTION STRUCTURE\nEach suggestion can include ANY combination of:\n- **removeUnits**: Units to remove from the list\n- **addUnits**: Units to add to the list\n- **addEnhancements**: Enhancements to add to characters\n\nExamples of valid suggestions:\n1. SIMPLE: Remove 1 unit, add 1 unit of similar cost\n2. MEDIUM: Remove 2 units, add 2-3 units + 1 enhancement\n3. COMPLEX: Remove 2 units, add 3 units + 2 enhancements + upgrade existing unit\n\n## CRITICAL RULES\n\n### Points Efficiency (MOST IMPORTANT)\n**Final list MUST be 1990-2000pts.

        "content": "You are suggesting army list modifications for a Space Wolves army using the Saga of the Great Wolf detachment.\n\n## CURRENT ARMY OVERVIEW\n- Total Points: 2010\n- **AVAILABLE_POINTS: -10** (2000pt Strike Force limit)\n- Units: 12 | Models: 50\n- Total Enhancements: 1/3 (max 3 per army)\n\n**POINTS BUDGET REMINDER:**\n- Each suggestion must result in a valid list at 1990-2000pts\n- pointsDelta should be between -10 and +-10\n- All 4 options are INDEPENDENT - each stands alone as a complete modification\n\n## DETACHMENT RULES: Saga of the Great Wolf\n**IMPORTANT**: Reference this detachment ability in your Army Quirks if it creates a unique mechanical attribute for this army!\n\n**Detachment Ability: Master of Wolves**\nWith Logan Grimnar commanding them, the hunting packs of the Space Wolves fight at peak efficiency.\n\nAt the start of your Command phase, you can select one of the Hunting Packs listed below. Until the start of your next Command phase, that Hunting Pack is active and its effects apply to all ADEPTUS ASTARTES units from your army. You can only select each Hunting Pack once per battle.\n\nEncircling Jaws: This unit can re-roll Advance rolls and Charge rolls.\nHunter's Eye: Each time a model in this unit makes a ranged attack, add 1 to the Hit roll.\nFerocious Strike: Each time this unit is selected to fight, select either the [LETHAL HITS] or [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability. Until the end of the phase, weapons equipped by models in this unit have the selected ability.\n\nHOWLING ONSLAUGHT\nOnce per battle, when selecting a Hunting Pack for the Master of Wolves Detachment rule, if a LOGAN GRIMNAR model from your army is on the battlefield, you can select a Hunting Pack you have already selected this battle.\n\nRESTRICTIONS\nYour army can include SPACE WOLVES units, but it cannot include any ADEPTUS ASTARTES units drawn from any other Chapter.\n\n## FACTION RULES (1)\nConsider how these interact with the detachment and unit abilities:\n\n**Oath of Moment** (army_rule)\nIf your Army Faction is ADEPTUS ASTARTES, at the start of your Command phase, select one unit from your opponent’s army. Until the start of your next Command phase, that enemy unit is your Oath of Moment target. Each time a model with this ability makes an attack that targets your Oath of Moment target:\n• You can re-roll the Hit roll.\n• If you are using a Codex: Space Marines Detachment and your army does not include one or more units with the BLACK TEMPLARS, BLOOD ANGELS, DARK ANGELS, DEATHWATCH or SPACE WOLVES keywords, add 1 to the Wound roll as well.\n\n## AVAILABLE STRATAGEMS (6)\n**CRITICAL**: In your analysis, identify the 2-3 MOST IMPORTANT stratagems for this specific army and explain:\n1. When to save CP for them (what situation triggers their use)\n2. Which units in the army benefit most from each\n3. Priority order if the player has limited CP\n\n**BATTLE INSTINCTS** (1CP)\n- When: Your opponent's Shooting phase, just after an enemy unit has shot.\n- Target: One SPACE WOLVES unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit's attacks.\n- Effect: Your unit can make a Normal move of up to D6\".\n- **Tactical Use**: Use to reposition onto objectives after surviving enemy fire, or to get into charge range.\n\n**EYE OF THE PACK** (1CP)\n- When: Your Shooting phase.\n- Target: One ADEPTUS ASTARTES unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot this phase.\n- Effect: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit makes an attack, you can add 1 to the Wound roll.\n- **Tactical Use**: Use on your damage-dealing units when attacking priority targets.\n\n**FENRISIAN FEROCITY** (1CP)\n- When: Your Movement phase or your Charge phase.\n- Target: One ADEPTUS ASTARTES MOUNTED or ADEPTUS ASTARTES WALKER unit from your army that has not been selected to move or charge this phase.\n- Effect: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit makes a Normal, Advance, Fall Back or Charge move, it can move horizontally through models (excluding TITANIC models) and terrain features. When doing so, it can move within Engagement Range of enemy models, but cannot end a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move within Engagement Range of them.\n- **Tactical Use**: Use for tactical repositioning - contest objectives or escape unfavorable combats.\n\n**GRIMNAR'S COMMAND** (1CP)\n- When: Your Command phase.\n- Target: One ADEPTUS ASTARTES unit from your army.\n- Effect: Select one Hunting Pack from the Master of Wolves Detachment rule. Until the start of your next Command phase, that Hunting Pack is active for your unit instead of any other Hunting Pack that is active, even if you have already selected that Hunting Pack this battle.\n\n**THE FOE FORESEEN** (1CP)\n- When: Your opponent's Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.\n- Target: One ADEPTUS ASTARTES unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit's attacks.\n- Effect: Until the attacking unit has finished making its attacks, each time an attack targets your unit, worsen the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.\n\n**UNRELENTING HUNTERS** (1CP)\n- When: Your Movement phase.\n- Target: One ADEPTUS ASTARTES unit from your army that has not been selected to move this phase.\n- Effect: Until the end of the turn, your unit is eligible to declare a charge in a turn in which it Fell Back. If your unit is a SPACE WOLVES unit, until the end of the turn, it is eligible to declare a charge in a turn in which it Advanced or Fell Back.\n- **Tactical Use**: Use for tactical repositioning - contest objectives or escape unfavorable combats.\n\n## AVAILABLE ENHANCEMENTS (4)\n**IMPORTANT**: If any of these are equipped on units in this army, explain how they change:\n1. Target priority (what units to attack/avoid)\n2. Positioning requirements (what range/position maximizes the enhancement)\n3. Synergies with other units or stratagems\n\n**Chariots of the Storm** (25pts)\nADEPTUS ASTARTES model only. After both players have deployed their armies, select up to three ADEPTUS ASTARTES units from your army and redeploy them. When doing so, you can set those units up in Strategic Reserves, regardless of how many units are already in Strategic Reserves.\nRestrictions: [\"ADEPTUS ASTARTES\"]\n\n**Grimnar's Mark** (20pts)\nADEPTUS ASTARTES TERMINATOR CAPTAIN model only. Once per battle round, from the second battle round onwards, you can target the bearer's unit with the Rapid Ingress or Heroic Intervention Stratagem for 0CP, and can do so even if you have already targeted a different unit with that Stratagem this turn.\n\nIn the Declare Battle Formations step, the bearer can be attached to a WOLF GUARD TERMINATORS unit.\nRestrictions: [\"ADEPTUS ASTARTES TERMINATOR CAPTAIN\"]\n\n**Howlmaw** (15pts)\nWOLF PRIEST model only. At the start of the Fight phase, you can select one enemy unit within 6\" of the bearer. That unit must take a Battle-shock, subtracting 1 from the result.\nRestrictions: [\"WOLF PRIEST\"]\n\n**Skjald's Foretelling** (25pts)\nWOLF GUARD BATTLE LEADER model only. While the bearer is leading a unit, weapons equipped by models in that unit have the [LANCE] ability.\nRestrictions: [\"WOLF GUARD BATTLE LEADER\"]\n\n\n## STRATEGIC ANALYSIS OUTPUT (from first analysis)\nThis is the complete strategic analysis of the current army.
