        "content": "You are an expert Warhammer 40,000 10th Edition strategic analyst. Analyze army lists to help players understand what makes THEIR SPECIFIC LIST unique - not generic faction advice.\n\n## Core Principle: LIST-SPECIFIC Analysis\nGeneric faction advice is NOT valuable - the player already knows their faction rules. Your job is to identify what makes THIS PARTICULAR LIST different from other lists using the same faction/detachment.\n\n## Stat Check Awareness\nWhen analyzing matchups, identify BINARY PASS/FAIL thresholds:\n- \"Can you kill their toughest model in one turn?\" (Knights T12/20W, C'tan with halve damage, Avatar)\n- \"Can they kill YOUR toughest model in one turn?\"\n- If halve-damage or damage reduction exists, note that D6 weapons become effectively D3 weapons\n- If the opponent has universal invuln saves (Custodes 4++), note that AP becomes less valuable\n\nInclude stat check conclusions in your reasoning when relevant. Example:\n\"Their Avatar halves damage, making your Lascannons deal avg 2 damage instead of 4. You need 6+ successful wound rolls to kill it. Switch to volume fire or accept attrition.\"\n\n## Resource Economy\nIdentify the opponent archetype's LIMITING RESOURCE and advise how to deplete it:\n- Aeldari: Fate Dice (finite pool - bait them on chaff before committing your key units)\n- Thousand Sons: Cabal Points (kill Characters early to reduce generation)\n- Sisters: Miracle Dice (generated on kills - deny them easy sacrificial units)\n- Necrons: Reanimation (don't split fire - overkill units completely or they heal back)\n- All armies: CP (bait defensive strats like Armour of Contempt on low-value targets first)\n\nIn your battle plan, name the resource if relevant to depleting their efficiency.\n\n## CRITICAL RULE: One Leader Per Unit\nIn 10th Edition, each unit can only have ONE leader attached. NEVER suggest attaching multiple leaders (like \"Logan AND Arjac\") to the same unit - this creates an ILLEGAL army. When a list has multiple leaders and multiple eligible units, distribute them: one leader per unit.\n\n## Identifying What Makes THIS List Unique\nBefore writing your analysis, identify:\n1. What's the single most unusual thing about this composition?\n2. What does this list do BETTER than typical lists of this faction?\n3. What does this list SACRIFICE compared to typical builds?\n4. If you played against this 10 times, what would you learn to fear most?\n\n## Output Requirements\n\n### Strategic Analysis\n- Strengths/weaknesses must name SPECIFIC rules, abilities, stratagems AND explain the tactical impact\n- Include which units benefit and HOW to exploit tactically\n- Weaknesses must include mitigation strategies using THIS army's tools\n\n### Viral Insights (Required)\n1. **Tagline**: 2-5 word phrase capturing THIS LIST's identity (not generic faction flavor)\n2. **Spirit Description**: One evocative sentence about how THIS LIST plays\n3. **4 Army Quirks**: Explain the TACTICAL IMPACT of unit composition choices, not just stats. Each quirk should highlight a different aspect of the army (e.g., durability, damage output, mobility, board control).\n\n   ### Quirk Quality Examples:\n   BAD (Stats Only - So What?):\n   - \"Storm Shields: 21/50 models\" ← Meaningless without tactical impact\n   - \"Deep Strike Units: 4 units\" ← Just a count, no insight\n\n   GOOD (Tactical Impact):\n   - \"AP Tax: 21 storm shields mean opponent's melta/plasma perform like bolters against your core\"\n   - \"Reserve Overload: 725pts threaten Turn 1-2 arrival, forcing defensive deployment OR accept casualties\"\n   - \"OC Desert: Only 5 models have reliable OC - you MUST kill to win, can't just hold\"\n\n   FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:\n   - Name: SHORT (aim <= 18 chars), Title Case, no emoji, no punctuation\n   - Value: SHORT (aim <= 12 chars). Prefer numbers/ratios/percents/points\n   - Description: SHORT (aim <= 140 chars), 1 sentence explaining WHY this matters tactically\n\n4. **Army Spirit Icon Prompt**: Detailed grimdark comic book style icon description with faction colors\n\n### Leader Attachment Rules (CRITICAL - 10th Edition)\nIn Warhammer 40K 10th Edition:\n- Each unit can only have ONE leader attached (with rare exceptions)\n- Each leader character can only attach to specific unit types (shown in \"CAN LEAD\" rules)\n- When suggesting leader attachments, you MUST ensure each leader goes to a DIFFERENT unit\n- If there are 2 characters and 2 eligible units, assign one character to each unit\n- NEVER suggest attaching multiple leaders to the same unit unless explicitly allowed by rules\n\n### Unit Tactical Summaries\nFor EVERY unit, provide a unique tactical summary explaining HOW to use it.\n\nCRITICAL: When the same datasheet appears multiple times at different sizes/points:\n- Identify which squad is the PRIMARY threat (larger, has character attached)\n- Identify secondary squads and their DIFFERENT role (flanking, objective grab, reserves)\n- Reference the SPECIFIC leader attachment - ensure each leader goes to a DIFFERENT unit\n\n### BAD (Multiple leaders to same unit - ILLEGAL IN 10TH EDITION):\n- \"Wolf Guard Terminators (340pts): Attach Logan Grimnar and Arjac Rockfist here. This is your primary win condition.\"\n  WHY ILLEGAL: You cannot attach 2 leaders to the same unit. This advice would result in an illegal army.\n\n### GOOD (One leader per unit - LEGAL):\n- \"Wolf Guard Terminators (340pts): ARJAC'S BRICK - His Fight on Death triggers on every model, making this 30W anvil deadly even when dying. Deploy on board to threaten the center.\"\n- \"Wolf Guard Terminators (170pts): LOGAN'S RESERVES - Use his Chapter Master Turn 1 reserves ability. Drop this flanking squad on a vulnerable objective while the main brick holds the center.\"\n\n### Matchup Considerations (REQUIRED - ALL 8 ARCHETYPES)\nYou MUST provide analysis for ALL 8 opponent archetypes:\n- horde_armies (Orks, Tyranids, Guard infantry spam)\n- elite_armies (Custodes, Knights, Deathwing)\n- vehicle_spam (Guard tanks, Ad Mech, Knights)\n- monster_mash (Tyranid monsters, Chaos Daemon engines)\n- skirmish_msu (Drukhari, Aeldari, fast multiple small units)\n- melee_rush (World Eaters, Blood Angels, Orks)\n- gunline (Tau, Guard artillery, Iron Hands)\n- attrition (Death Guard, Necrons, durable grind armies)\n\nFor EACH matchup, provide:\n1. **Rating**: Be honest - not every matchup is \"even\". If this list struggles against hordes, say \"unfavorable\"\n2. **Win Condition**: What is your MACRO strategy against this archetype? Choose one:\n   - outscore: You can't kill them efficiently; focus on Primary/Secondary scoring\n   - tabling: You can mathematically remove their army\n   - attrition: Grind them down over 5 turns, trading efficiently\n   - alpha_strike: Cripple them T1-2 before they can respond\n   - denial: Prevent their win condition (kill their scoring, screen their deep strike)\n3. **Battle Plan**: One sentence combining: what you must kill/do, WHEN to do it (turn/phase), and their resource to deplete if applicable\n4. **Reasoning**: Explain WHY using THIS LIST's specific units and weaknesses (include stat check awareness if relevant)\n5. **Key Tips**: 3-4 actionable tips covering different game phases:\n   - DEPLOYMENT: Where to position, what to reserve\n   - EARLY GAME (T1-2): Screening, bait plays, resource denial\n   - COMMITMENT (T2-3): When to drop reserves, commit charges\n   - TARGET PRIORITY: What to kill first and why\n   Each tip should specify WHEN (turn/phase) not just WHAT.\n\n### BAD Matchup Analysis (Generic):\n\"Against vehicle spam, use your anti-tank units to destroy their vehicles.\"\nWHY BAD: No win condition, no timing, no stat check, no resource consideration. Applies to any army.\n\n### GOOD Matchup Analysis (Specific):\nwinCondition: \"denial\"\nbattlePlan: \"Screen their T2 deep strike zones, then focus-fire Characters to strip buffs. Outscore them 3-2 on Primary.\"\nreasoning: \"FAVORABLE. Their Knights stat-check most lists, but your 20 Thunder Hammers (S12, AP-2, D3) deal avg 14 damage per charge phase - enough to bracket a Knight. If they halve damage (Rotate Ion Shields), switch to volume attacks. The risk: if they screen with Armigers, your hammers get stuck.\"\nkeyTips: [\n  \"DEPLOYMENT: Castle Terminators mid-board behind Obscuring. Reserve TWC for T2 flank.\",\n  \"T1: Screen 9 inches from board edges with Intercessors to deny Rapid Ingress slots.\",\n  \"T2-3: Drop TWC on backfield objectives. Charge screening Armigers to clear paths.\",\n  \"PRIORITY: Kill Armigers first to expose big Knights. Focus one Knight at a time - no split fire.\"\n]\nWHY GOOD: Names win condition, timing, stat check awareness, specific unit counts/abilities, phased tips, and counter-play risk.\n\n### Role Assignments\nAssign roles based on actual battlefield purpose: hammer, anvil, scoring, screening, support, skirmisher, utility, specialist\n\nProvide analysis in the exact JSON schema format specified."

        "content": "Analyze this Warhammer 40K 10th Edition army list with a focus on TACTICAL ROLES and REALISTIC GAMEPLAY.\n\n## ARMY OVERVIEW\n- **Faction:** Space Wolves\n- **Detachment:** Saga of the Great Wolf\n- **Total Points:** 2010\n- **Units:** 12 | **Models:** 50\n\n## RADAR SCORES (0-100 scale)\n- Killing Power: 100\n- Durability: 100\n- Mobility: 73\n- Board Control: 100\n- Flexibility: 65\n\n## DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS\n- Deep Strike: YES (Arjac Rockfist, Logan Grimnar, Inceptor Squad, Wolf Guard Terminators, Wolf Guard Terminators)\n- Infiltrate: YES (Lieutenant with Combi-weapon)\n- FLY units: Inceptor Squad\n\n## DETACHMENT RULES: Saga of the Great Wolf\n**IMPORTANT**: Reference this detachment ability in your Army Quirks if it creates a unique mechanical attribute for this army!\n\n**Detachment Ability: Master of Wolves**\nWith Logan Grimnar commanding them, the hunting packs of the Space Wolves fight at peak efficiency.\n\nAt the start of your Command phase, you can select one of the Hunting Packs listed below. Until the start of your next Command phase, that Hunting Pack is active and its effects apply to all ADEPTUS ASTARTES units from your army. You can only select each Hunting Pack once per battle.\n\nEncircling Jaws: This unit can re-roll Advance rolls and Charge rolls.\nHunter's Eye: Each time a model in this unit makes a ranged attack, add 1 to the Hit roll.\nFerocious Strike: Each time this unit is selected to fight, select either the [LETHAL HITS] or [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability. Until the end of the phase, weapons equipped by models in this unit have the selected ability.\n\nHOWLING ONSLAUGHT\nOnce per battle, when selecting a Hunting Pack for the Master of Wolves Detachment rule, if a LOGAN GRIMNAR model from your army is on the battlefield, you can select a Hunting Pack you have already selected this battle.\n\nRESTRICTIONS\nYour army can include SPACE WOLVES units, but it cannot include any ADEPTUS ASTARTES units drawn from any other Chapter.\n\n## FACTION RULES (1)\nConsider how these interact with the detachment and unit abilities:\n\n**Oath of Moment** (army_rule)\nIf your Army Faction is ADEPTUS ASTARTES, at the start of your Command phase, select one unit from your opponent’s army. Until the start of your next Command phase, that enemy unit is your Oath of Moment target. Each time a model with this ability makes an attack that targets your Oath of Moment target:\n• You can re-roll the Hit roll.\n• If you are using a Codex: Space Marines Detachment and your army does not include one or more units with the BLACK TEMPLARS, BLOOD ANGELS, DARK ANGELS, DEATHWATCH or SPACE WOLVES keywords, add 1 to the Wound roll as well.\n\n## AVAILABLE STRATAGEMS (6)\n**CRITICAL**: In your analysis, identify the 2-3 MOST IMPORTANT stratagems for this specific army and explain:\n1. When to save CP for them (what situation triggers their use)\n2. Which units in the army benefit most from each\n3. Priority order if the player has limited CP\n\n**BATTLE INSTINCTS** (1CP)\n- When: Your opponent's Shooting phase, just after an enemy unit has shot.\n- Target: One SPACE WOLVES unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit's attacks.\n- Effect: Your unit can make a Normal move of up to D6\".\n- **Tactical Use**: Use to reposition onto objectives after surviving enemy fire, or to get into charge range.\n\n**EYE OF THE PACK** (1CP)\n- When: Your Shooting phase.\n- Target: One ADEPTUS ASTARTES unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot this phase.\n- Effect: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit makes an attack, you can add 1 to the Wound roll.\n- **Tactical Use**: Use on your damage-dealing units when attacking priority targets.\n\n**FENRISIAN FEROCITY** (1CP)\n- When: Your Movement phase or your Charge phase.\n- Target: One ADEPTUS ASTARTES MOUNTED or ADEPTUS ASTARTES WALKER unit from your army that has not been selected to move or charge this phase.\n- Effect: Until the end of the phase, each time a model in your unit makes a Normal, Advance, Fall Back or Charge move, it can move horizontally through models (excluding TITANIC models) and terrain features. When doing so, it can move within Engagement Range of enemy models, but cannot end a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move within Engagement Range of them.\n- **Tactical Use**: Use for tactical repositioning - contest objectives or escape unfavorable combats.\n\n**GRIMNAR'S COMMAND** (1CP)\n- When: Your Command phase.\n- Target: One ADEPTUS ASTARTES unit from your army.\n- Effect: Select one Hunting Pack from the Master of Wolves Detachment rule. Until the start of your next Command phase, that Hunting Pack is active for your unit instead of any other Hunting Pack that is active, even if you have already selected that Hunting Pack this battle.\n\n**THE FOE FORESEEN** (1CP)\n- When: Your opponent's Shooting phase or the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has selected its targets.\n- Target: One ADEPTUS ASTARTES unit from your army that was selected as the target of one or more of the attacking unit's attacks.\n- Effect: Until the attacking unit has finished making its attacks, each time an attack targets your unit, worsen the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.\n\n**UNRELENTING HUNTERS** (1CP)\n- When: Your Movement phase.\n- Target: One ADEPTUS ASTARTES unit from your army that has not been selected to move this phase.\n- Effect: Until the end of the turn, your unit is eligible to declare a charge in a turn in which it Fell Back. If your unit is a SPACE WOLVES unit, until the end of the turn, it is eligible to declare a charge in a turn in which it Advanced or Fell Back.\n- **Tactical Use**: Use for tactical repositioning - contest objectives or escape unfavorable combats.\n\n## AVAILABLE ENHANCEMENTS (4)\n**IMPORTANT**: If any of these are equipped on units in this army, explain how they change:\n1. Target priority (what units to attack/avoid)\n2. Positioning requirements (what range/position maximizes the enhancement)\n3. Synergies with other units or stratagems\n\n**Chariots of the Storm** (25pts)\nADEPTUS ASTARTES model only. After both players have deployed their armies, select up to three ADEPTUS ASTARTES units from your army and redeploy them. When doing so, you can set those units up in Strategic Reserves, regardless of how many units are already in Strategic Reserves.\nRestrictions: [\"ADEPTUS ASTARTES\"]\n\n**Grimnar's Mark** (20pts)\nADEPTUS ASTARTES TERMINATOR CAPTAIN model only. Once per battle round, from the second battle round onwards, you can target the bearer's unit with the Rapid Ingress or Heroic Intervention Stratagem for 0CP, and can do so even if you have already targeted a different unit with that Stratagem this turn.\n\nIn the Declare Battle Formations step, the bearer can be attached to a WOLF GUARD TERMINATORS unit.\nRestrictions: [\"ADEPTUS ASTARTES TERMINATOR CAPTAIN\"]\n\n**Howlmaw** (15pts)\nWOLF PRIEST model only. At the start of the Fight phase, you can select one enemy unit within 6\" of the bearer. That unit must take a Battle-shock, subtracting 1 from the result.\nRestrictions: [\"WOLF PRIEST\"]\n\n**Skjald's Foretelling** (25pts)\nWOLF GUARD BATTLE LEADER model only. While the bearer is leading a unit, weapons equipped by models in that unit have the [LANCE] ability.\nRestrictions: [\"WOLF GUARD BATTLE LEADER\"]\n\n## DETACHMENT-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS REQUIRED\n\nFor the **Saga of the Great Wolf** detachment, your analysis MUST address:\n\n1. **Detachment Ability Sequencing**: If the detachment has turn-by-turn choices (like Hunting Packs, Combat Doctrines, etc.), explain WHICH option to use in WHICH turn and WHY based on this army's composition.\n\n2. **Key Character Abilities**: If special characters are present (Logan Grimnar, Guilliman, etc.), explain when to use their unique abilities for maximum impact.\n\n3. **Stratagem Priority**: From the available stratagems, identify the 2-3 MOST IMPORTANT ones for this specific army and explain WHEN to use them (save CP for X when Y happens).\n\n4. **Enhancement Synergies**: Reference the equipped enhancements by name and explain how they change target priority or tactical options.\n\n## ARMY COMPOSITION BY TACTICAL ROLE\nNote: Not all units will deal damage every turn. Roles indicate how each unit should be used.\n\n## HAMMERS (7 units, 1555 pts)\nPrimary damage dealers - units meant to eliminate enemy threats\n\n### Bjorn the Fell-Handed - 1 model\nStats: M9\" | T9 | 2+/none | W8 | OC3 | Ld6\nWeapons:\n  - Heavy flamer (12\", AD6, S5, AP-1, D1, IGNORES COVER, TORRENT)\n  - Helfrost cannon – dispersed (12\", AD6, S6, AP-1, D2, TORRENT)\n  - Trueclaw (Melee, A6, S12, AP-2, D3, LETHAL HITS)\nAbilities: Deadly Demise 1, Feel No Pain 5+, Oath of Moment, Legendary Tenacity, Ancient Tactician\nTier: A - Bjorn is widely considered a cornerstone of competitive Space Wolves lists, appearing in approximately 72% of top-performing tournament rosters\nKey Synergies: Logan Grimnar, Iron Priests (for healing and hit buffs)\nBest vs: High-strength anti-tank units (S10+), Elite infantry (via Helfrost Cannon)\nWeak vs: High-volume mid-strength attacks (S5-S9) that bypass his -1 to wound modifier, Concentrated heavy firepower\nPlaystyle: Bjorn acts as a force multiplier and durability anchor. Players should focus on his survival above all else in the early game. Once the mid-game begins, his 9-inch movement and respectable melee profile allow him to commit to combat and contest central objectives effectively.\nCompetitive Notes: Bjorn's primary competitive utility is his ability to generate 1 CP every Command Phase he is on the board. Defensively, he is exceptionally efficient: despite having only 8 wounds at Toughness 9, his 5+ Feel No Pain and -1 to wound modifier against attacks with Strength 10 or higher give him the effective durability of a 12-wound model. While he lost his previous ability to increase the cost of enemy Stratagems, his own CP generation remains vital for modern 10th Edition play.\nLoadout focus: anti-elite, anti-horde, force multiplier weapons\n\n### Inceptor Squad - 6 models\nStats: M10\" | T6 | 3+/none | W18 | OC1 | Ld6\nWeapons:\n  - Close combat weapon (Melee, A3, S3, AP0, D1)\n  - Plasma exterminators (18\", A2, S7, AP-2, D2, ASSAULT 2, PISTOL, TWIN-LINKED)\nAbilities: Deep Strike, Meteoric Descent\n\n### Thunderwolf Cavalry - 6 models\nStats: M12\" | T6 | 3+/4+ | W24 | OC2 | Ld6\nWeapons:\n  - Teeth and claws (Melee, A3, S4, AP0, D1, EXTRA ATTACKS)\n  - Wolf Guard weapon (Melee, A4, S5, AP-2, D2)\nAbilities: Thunderous Charge, Storm Shield\nTier: S - Universally regarded as the premier mounted unit in the game, appearing in over 90% of competitive Space Wolves lists\nKey Synergies: Stormlance Task Force (Advance and Charge), Logan Grimnar\nBest vs: Heavy Infantry, Terminators\nWeak vs: Dense Terrain (Mounted keyword movement restrictions), Move blocking by cheap screens\nPlaystyle: Can be run as massive 6-man bricks for maximum durability and 'jail' potential, or 3-man units for efficient trading and skirmishing. They gain +1 Damage to rider weapons on the charge (increasing to Damage 3), making them significantly more lethal as shock cavalry than in protracted combats. They excel at grinding down targets over multiple turns due to their 4+ invulnerable save.\nCompetitive Notes: The unit defines the current Space Wolves meta. Their ability to Advance and Charge in the Stormlance Task Force creates a massive threat range that dictates the flow of the game. They are considered one of the three most essential units in the roster, often serving as the core of '193 wounds' list archetypes designed to overwhelm the opponent's math.\n\n### Vindicator - 1 model\nStats: M9\" | T11 | 2+/none | W11 | OC3 | Ld6\nWeapons:\n  - Demolisher cannon (24\", AD6+3, S14, AP-3, DD6, BLAST)\n  - Armoured tracks (Melee, A3, S6, AP0, D1)\nAbilities: SIEGE SHIELD\nTier: B - The Vindicator is universally regarded as a solid, viable 'B-Tier' choice\nKey Synergies: Iron Priest (Repairs/Hit buffs), Gladius Task Force (Combat Doctrines)\nBest vs: Knights, Heavy Vehicles\nWeak vs: Range kiting (outranging the 24-inch cannon), Maneuverability-reducing effects\nPlaystyle: Acts as an 'armor cracker' to soften or destroy heavy targets, clearing the way for melee units like Wulfen or Thunderwolf Cavalry to take objectives. It is most effective when used in pairs to ensure target saturation and redundancy.\nCompetitive Notes: The Vindicator has emerged as a primary shooting choice for Space Wolf players following nerfs to other armored options. It is frequently run in pairs or as part of a 'gun tank' package alongside Ballistus Dreadnoughts or Gladiators. Data suggests that approximately 48% of top-performing Space Wolf lists (4-1 or better) utilize at least two units from this heavy fire support category.\nLoadout focus: anti-armor, anti-horde\n\n### Wolf Guard Headtakers - 12 models\nStats: M7\" | T4 | 3+/none | W36 | OC1 | Ld6\nWeapons:\n  - Heavy bolt pistol (18\", A1, S4, AP-1, D1)\n  - Paired master-crafted power weapons (Melee, A5, S5, AP-2, D2)\n  - Teeth and claws (Melee, A2, S4, AP0, D1)\nAbilities: LET LOOSE THE WOLVES, HEADHUNTERS\nCAN LEAD: This unit can be led by: Iron Priest, Njal Stormcaller, Ragnar Blackmane, Ulrik The Slayer, Wolf Guard Battle Leader, Wolf Priest, Krom Dragongaze\nTier: B - While one source places them in the lower half of the top tier (A), the consensus among most analysts and tournament data (Sources 2, 3, 4, and 5) identifies them as a solid B-tier unit\nKey Synergies: Ragnar Blackmane (Advance and Charge), Wolf Priest (+1 to wound and model revival)\nBest vs: Elite Infantry, Characters (via Precision)\nWeak vs: High-volume anti-infantry fire, Damage 3 weaponry (efficiently clears 3W profiles)\nPlaystyle: Effectiveness is tied to character synergy. Use Ragnar Blackmane to grant Advance and Charge for a high-speed threat, or a Wolf Priest for +1 to wound and model revival. Use the Quarry mechanic to bypass high-toughness defenses with Devastating Wounds or to snipe support characters with Precision.\nCompetitive Notes: The Headtakers are elite 3-wound models that provide unique utility through the 'Quarry' mechanic, granting Devastating Wounds and Precision against specific targets. They are often used as a 'melee missile' or a specialized character-hunting unit. While powerful, they are frequently compared to Wolf Guard Terminators, who often provide better durability for the points.\n\n### Wolf Guard Terminators (340pts) - 10 models\nStats: M6\" | T5 | 2+/4+ | W30 | OC1 | Ld6\nWeapons:\n  - Relic greataxe (Melee, A4, S7, AP-2, D3, DEVASTATING WOUNDS)\n  - Assault cannon (24\", A6, S6, AP0, D1, DEVASTATING WOUNDS)\n  - Master-crafted power weapon (Melee, A4, S5, AP-2, D2)\n  - Power fist (Melee, A3, S6, AP-2, D2)\nAbilities: Rugged Resilience, Storm Shield\nCAN LEAD: Can be led by: Arjac Rockfist; Logan Grimnar; Krom Dragongaze; Wolf Guard Battle Leader In Terminator Armour\nTier: A - Wolf Guard Terminators are widely considered a staple of competitive Space Wolves lists, with some analysts ranking them as S-tier due to a 92% inclusion rate in top-placing rosters\nKey Synergies: Logan Grimnar (Enables Turn 1 Deep Strike), Arjac Rockfist (Provides 4+ Fight on Death and Character sniping)\nBest vs: Heavy Infantry, Elite Infantry\nWeak vs: High-volume low-strength fire (to bypass -1 to wound), Dedicated high-power melee\nPlaystyle: Play them as a 'grind' unit rather than a burst damage dealer. They excel at hunkering down on central objectives and acting as ablative wounds for powerful characters like Logan Grimnar or Arjac Rockfist. In 10-man blocks, they function as a massive, durable anchor for the army.\nCompetitive Notes: The unit is a cornerstone of the 'Wolf Jail' archetype, designed to pin opponents in their deployment zone. Their T5, 2+ save, and 4++ invulnerable save (via Storm Shields) combined with -1 to wound makes them one of the most points-efficient 'grind' units in the game. They are often ignored by opponents in favor of faster Thunderwolf Cavalry, allowing them to dominate the mid-board through attrition.\nLoadout focus: force multiplier weapons\n\n### Wolf Guard Terminators (170pts) - 5 models\nStats: M6\" | T5 | 2+/4+ | W15 | OC1 | Ld6\nWeapons:\n  - Master-crafted power weapon (Melee, A4, S5, AP-2, D2)\nAbilities: Rugged Resilience\nCAN LEAD: Can be led by: Arjac Rockfist; Logan Grimnar; Krom Dragongaze; Wolf Guard Battle Leader In Terminator Armour\nTier: A - Wolf Guard Terminators are widely considered a staple of competitive Space Wolves lists, with some analysts ranking them as S-tier due to a 92% inclusion rate in top-placing rosters\nKey Synergies: Logan Grimnar (Enables Turn 1 Deep Strike), Arjac Rockfist (Provides 4+ Fight on Death and Character sniping)\nBest vs: Heavy Infantry, Elite Infantry\nWeak vs: High-volume low-strength fire (to bypass -1 to wound), Dedicated high-power melee\nPlaystyle: Play them as a 'grind' unit rather than a burst damage dealer. They excel at hunkering down on central objectives and acting as ablative wounds for powerful characters like Logan Grimnar or Arjac Rockfist. In 10-man blocks, they function as a massive, durable anchor for the army.\nCompetitive Notes: The unit is a cornerstone of the 'Wolf Jail' archetype, designed to pin opponents in their deployment zone. Their T5, 2+ save, and 4++ invulnerable save (via Storm Shields) combined with -1 to wound makes them one of the most points-efficient 'grind' units in the game. They are often ignored by opponents in favor of faster Thunderwolf Cavalry, allowing them to dominate the mid-board through attrition.\n\n## SKIRMISHERS (1 units, 240 pts)\nMobile harassment - units that threaten flanks and pick off weak targets\n\n### Inceptor Squad - 6 models\nStats: M10\" | T6 | 3+/none | W18 | OC1 | Ld6\nWeapons:\n  - Close combat weapon (Melee, A3, S3, AP0, D1)\n  - Plasma exterminators (18\", A2, S7, AP-2, D2, ASSAULT 2, PISTOL, TWIN-LINKED)\nAbilities: Deep Strike, Meteoric Descent\n\n## SUPPORT (2 units, 160 pts)\nForce multipliers - characters that buff other units\n\n### Lieutenant with Combi-weapon - 1 model\nStats: M6\" | T4 | 3+/none | W4 | OC1 | Ld6\nWeapons:\n  - Combi-weapon (24\", A1, S4, AP0, D1, ANTI-INFANTRY 4+, DEVASTATING WOUNDS, RAPID FIRE 1)\n  - Paired combat blades (Melee, A5, S4, AP-1, D1, ANTI-INFANTRY 4+, SUSTAINED HITS 1)\nAbilities: FEEL NO PAIN 5+, INFILTRATORS, LONE OPERATIVE, STEALTH, OATH OF MOMENT — PRIORITY OBJECTIVE IDENTIFIED\nTier: A - The Lieutenant with Combi-weapon is widely considered a competitive staple, appearing in approximately 80% of top-placing lists\nKey Synergies: Arjac Rockfist, Logan Grimnar\nBest vs: Enemy units on a marked objective, One-wound infantry\nWeak vs: Close-range attackers (within 12 inches to bypass Lone Operative), Fast-moving melee units that can pin him down\nPlaystyle: Play him as a 'ghost' unit. Utilize his reactive movement ability to move D6 inches when an enemy ends a move within 9 inches, allowing him to slip behind terrain and avoid charges. He should focus on performing secondary actions and providing his reroll aura rather than seeking direct combat.\nCompetitive Notes: This unit is a 'Lone Wolf' utility powerhouse. Its primary value lies in its 'Priority Objective' ability, which grants friendly units rerolls (specifically wound rolls of 1) against targets near a chosen objective. Combined with Lone Operative, Stealth, and a Feel No Pain, it is exceptionally difficult to remove for its points cost.\nLoadout focus: force multiplier weapons\n\n### Wolf Guard Battle Leader - 1 model\nStats: M7\" | T4 | 3+/4+ | W5 | OC1 | Ld6\nWeapons:\n  - Master-crafted power weapon (Melee, A5, S5, AP-2, D2)\nEnhancements: Skjald’s Foretelling\nAbilities: LEADER, Heroic Last Stand, Storm Shield\nCAN LEAD: This model can be attached to the following units: Blood Claws; Grey Hunters; Wolf Guard Headtakers\nLeader bonus: Tempered Ferocity: While this model is leading a unit, weapons equipped by models in that unit have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability and, each time a model in that unit makes an attack that targets an enemy unit within 6\", re-roll a Hit roll of 1.\nTier: B - While the Wolf Guard Battle Leader possesses an exceptionally efficient datasheet for its points cost—featuring 6 wounds, a 4+ invulnerable save, and potent offensive buffs—its competitive standing is limited by the current meta-viability of the units it can lead\nKey Synergies: Ragnar Blackmane, Blood Claws\nBest vs: Super heavies (when leading high-volume melee units), Elite infantry\nWeak vs: Precision attacks (to target his 6 wounds directly), High-damage melee units\nPlaystyle: Focus on maximizing damage consistency through hit rerolls and Sustained Hits, which provides a roughly 45% damage increase for WS 3+ units. Use him as a duelist to fish for Devastating Wounds against high-toughness targets.\nCompetitive Notes: The unit serves as a premier force multiplier, providing Sustained Hits 1 to its attached unit and a 6-inch aura for rerolling hit rolls of 1. It is highly durable for a low-cost character and features a unique 2+ 'Fight on Death' ability that applies specifically to the Battle Leader himself, ensuring he contributes even when targeted first.\n\n## SCORING (1 units, 80 pts)\nObjective holders - units for actions and holding ground\n\n### Intercessor Squad - 5 models\nStats: M6\" | T4 | 3+/none | W10 | OC2 | Ld6\nWeapons:\n  - Bolt pistol (12\", A1, S4, AP0, D1, PISTOL)\n  - Bolt rifle (24\", A2, S4, AP-1, D1, ASSAULT, HEAVY)\n  - Close combat weapon (Melee, A3, S3, AP0, D1)\nAbilities: Oath of Moment — Objective Secured\nCAN LEAD: This unit can be led by the following units: Adrax Agatone; Ancient; Apothecary; Captain; Chaplain; Chief Librarian Tigurius; Judiciar; Kor’sarro Khan; Librarian; Lieutenant; Lieutenant Titus; Marneus Calgar; Techmarine; Uriel Ventris; Inquisitor; Inquisitor Coteaz; Inquisitor Draxus; Inquisitor Greyfax; Castellan; Chaplain Grimaldus; Emperor’s Champion; High Marshal Helbrecht; Marshal; Blood Angels Captain; Sanguinary Priest; Asmodai; Azrael; Ezekiel; Lazarus; Brother Corbulo; Captain Tycho; Gabriel Seth; Inquisitor Eisenhorn; Inquisitor In Terminator Armour; Primaris Company Champion.\nTier: B - While Source 1 ranks them as Tier A due to high inclusion rates in tournament lists, the consensus across most sources (Sources 2, 3, and 4) places them in Tier B\nKey Synergies: Infiltrators (for backfield screening), Scouts (for early board control)\nBest vs: Light infantry, Horde units\nWeak vs: High-volume anti-infantry fire, Precision weapons (targeting the Sergeant's Power Fist)\nPlaystyle: Focus on mission utility over combat. Use the 'sticky objectives' rule to free up the unit for movement. They should be used to perform actions or hold points while more specialized units like Blood Claws or Dreadnoughts engage the enemy. Equipping the Sergeant with a Power Fist and the squad with a Grenade Launcher provides a small but necessary threat against tougher targets.\nCompetitive Notes: Intercessors are a fundamental utility unit in competitive Space Wolves lists, primarily valued for their 'Objective Secured' ability. They are rarely taken in large numbers, with most competitive lists opting for a single 5-man squad to handle backfield duties or early-game objective marking. Their high Objective Control (OC) makes them effective at flipping contested mid-board objectives if the backfield is secure.\n\n## SCREENING (2 units, 215 pts)\nFlexible/utility - remaining units for various roles\n\n### Arjac Rockfist - 1 model\nStats: M6\" | T5 | 2+/4+ | W6 | OC1 | Ld6\nWeapons:\n  - Foehammer (Ranged) (6\", A1, S8, AP0, D3, ANTI-MONSTER 3+, ANTI-VEHICLE 3+, ASSAULT)\n  - Foehammer (Melee) (Melee, A5, S8, AP-2, D3, ANTI-MONSTER 3+, ANTI-VEHICLE 3+, PRECISION)\nAbilities: Deep Strike, Leader, Oath of Moment, Champion of the Kingsguard\nCAN LEAD: This model can be attached to the following unit: Wolf Guard Terminators\nLeader bonus: Anvil of Endurance: While this model is leading a unit, each time a model in that unit is destroyed by a melee attack, if that model has not fought this phase, roll one D6: on a 4+, do not remove the destroyed model from play. The destroyed model can fight after the attacking unit has finished making its attacks, and is then removed from play.\nTier: A - Arjac is widely considered a cornerstone of competitive Space Wolves lists, appearing in approximately 80% of top-placing tournament rosters\nKey Synergies: Wolf Guard Terminators (10-man squad with Storm Shields), Logan Grimnar (for Battle Round 1 reserves)\nBest vs: Monsters, Vehicles (T9+)\nWeak vs: High-volume AP-2/3 fire, Screening units (to prevent Deep Strike/Charges)\nPlaystyle: Use Arjac to hunt enemy heroes using his Precision keyword and full rerolls to hit and wound. In combat against heavy armor, his Anti-Monster/Vehicle 3+ allows him to punch significantly above his weight class. He should be played aggressively to contest the mid-board, relying on his unit's durability and his own 'Fight on Death' aura to win attrition wars.\nCompetitive Notes: Arjac functions as both a 'beatstick' and a 'scalpel.' His ability to grant 'Fight on Death' to his unit ensures that even if his Terminator brick is charged by a superior melee threat, they will trade effectively. He is one of the few units in the roster capable of reliably downing heavy armor in close combat while simultaneously acting as a character assassin via inherent Precision and full rerolls.\nLoadout focus: anti-elite\n\n### Logan Grimnar - 1 model\nStats: M6\" | T5 | 2+/4+ | W8 | OC1 | Ld6\nWeapons:\n  - Storm bolter (24\", A2, S4, AP0, D1, RAPID FIRE 2)\n  - Axe Morkai — strike (Melee, A6, S8, AP-2, D3)\n  - Tyrnak and Fenrir (Melee, A6, S5, AP-1, D1, EXTRA ATTACKS)\nAbilities: Deep Strike, Leader, High King of Fenris\nCAN LEAD: This model can be attached to the following unit: Wolf Guard Terminators\nTier: S - Logan Grimnar is widely considered an auto-include staple in the Space Wolves faction, appearing in approximately 92% of top-placing tournament lists\nKey Synergies: Wolf Guard Terminators, Arjac Rockfist\nBest vs: Stratagem-reliant armies, Medium-sized infantry\nWeak vs: Unreliable 9-inch charges, Heavy ranged fire (when positioned solo)\nPlaystyle: Can be played as a solo disruption piece to maximize the 12-inch CP debuff aura or attached to a large brick of Wolf Guard Terminators for durability. He is a high-utility force multiplier that forces opponents to overspend resources while providing early-game board pressure.\nCompetitive Notes: Logan's primary value lies in his 'Lord of Deceit' ability, which functions similarly to a Callidus Assassin by increasing the cost of enemy stratagems within 12 inches. He is also valued for his large base size, which tactically simplifies melee engagement for attached units by making it easier for models to maintain eligibility to fight.\nLoadout focus: anti-elite\n\n\n## IDENTIFIED GAPS\n- Limited objective-holding units\n\n## OBJECTIVE PLAY CAPACITY\n- Total OC: 65\n- Action Units: 5\n- Average Movement: 8\"\n\n## ALL UNIT IDENTIFIERS (for tactical summaries and role assignments)\nUse these exact names when referencing units in your analysis:\n- Arjac Rockfist\n- Bjorn the Fell-Handed\n- Lieutenant with Combi-weapon\n- Logan Grimnar\n- Wolf Guard Battle Leader\n- Intercessor Squad\n- Inceptor Squad\n- Thunderwolf Cavalry\n- Vindicator\n- Wolf Guard Headtakers\n- Wolf Guard Terminators (340pts)\n- Wolf Guard Terminators (170pts)\n\n---\n\n## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS\n\nProvide your strategic analysis in JSON format. CRITICAL: Make every section specific to THIS list, not generic faction advice.\n\n**Army Quirks (4 required)**: Discover the 4 most interesting/unusual aspects of THIS specific list composition. Each quirk must explain TACTICAL IMPACT, not just state a statistic. Cover different aspects: durability, damage output, mobility, board control.\n\n**Unit Tactical Summaries**: For EVERY unit, provide a UNIQUE tactical summary. If the same datasheet appears multiple times (e.g., 2 Terminator squads), each MUST have different advice reflecting their different roles (primary hammer vs flanking unit, etc.).\n\n**Unit Role Assignments**: Assign roles based on actual battlefield purpose, considering squad size and likely leader attachments.\n\nFocus on what would surprise someone who hasn't seen this exact list."
