        "executiveSummary": "This Space Wolves list is a formidable 'HeroHammer' composition that sacrifices board width for an overwhelming concentration of durability and melee lethality. Built around a massive Terminator 'Death Star' led by Logan Grimnar and Arjac, and supported by fast-moving Thunderwolf Cavalry, the army functions as a crushing avalanche that seeks to table the opponent rather than winning on technical scoring. Success relies on precise timing of the 'Master of Wolves' Sagas to deliver a knockout blow on Turn 2 or 3 while the Vindicator and Inceptors strip enemy armor.",
